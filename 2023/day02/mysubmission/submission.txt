What is Linux?

Linux is a free and open-source operating system based on Unix-like operating systems. It was created in 1991 by Finnish computer science student Linus Torvalds, who was looking for a free alternative to the proprietary Unix operating system. Linux is now one of the most widely used operating systems in the world, powering everything from smartphones and personal computers to servers and supercomputers. One of the key features of Linux is its flexibility and customizability, which allows users to modify and adapt the system to suit their specific needs. Linux is also known for its stability, security, and reliability, which has made it a popular choice for businesses and organizations around the world.
